# Hub-labeling

This C++ code computes a hub labeling (aka 2-hop labeling) of a weighted directed graph. A hub-labeling is a compact representation of the distance matrix of the graph. The algorithm is based on [Robust Distance Queries on Massive Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44777-2_27).
